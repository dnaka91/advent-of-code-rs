<p>Wandering further through the circuits of the computer, you come upon a tower of programs that
have gotten themselves into a bit of trouble. A recursive algorithm has gotten out of hand, and
now they're balanced precariously in a large tower.</p>
<p>One program at the bottom supports the entire tower. It's holding a large disc, and on the disc
are balanced several more sub-towers. At the bottom of these sub-towers, standing on the bottom
disc, are other programs, each holding <strong>their</strong> own disc, and so on. At the very tops of these
sub-sub-sub-...-towers, many programs stand simply keeping the disc below them balanced but with
no disc of their own.</p>
<p>You offer to help, but first you need to understand the structure of these towers. You ask each
program to yell out their <strong>name</strong>, their <strong>weight</strong>, and (if they're holding a disc) the
<strong>names of the programs immediately above them</strong> balancing on that disc. You write this
information down (your puzzle input). Unfortunately, in their panic, they don't do this in an
orderly fashion; by the time you're done, you're not sure which program gave which information.</p>
<p>For example, if your list is the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">pbga (66)
xhth (57)
ebii (61)
havc (66)
ktlj (57)
fwft (72) -&gt; ktlj, cntj, xhth
qoyq (66)
padx (45) -&gt; pbga, havc, qoyq
tknk (41) -&gt; ugml, padx, fwft
jptl (61)
ugml (68) -&gt; gyxo, ebii, jptl
gyxo (61)
cntj (57)
</code></pre>
<p>...then you would be able to recreate the structure of the towers that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">                gyxo
              /
         ugml - ebii
       /      \
      |         jptl
      |
      |         pbga
     /        /
tknk --- padx - havc
     \        \
      |         qoyq
      |
      |         ktlj
       \      /
         fwft - cntj
              \
                xhth
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, <code>tknk</code> is at the bottom of the tower (the <strong>bottom program</strong>), and is holding
up <code>ugml</code>, <code>padx</code>, and <code>fwft</code>. Those programs are, in turn, holding up other programs; in this
example, none of those programs are holding up any other programs, and are all the tops of their
own towers. (The actual tower balancing in front of you is much larger.)</p>
<p>Before you're ready to help them, you need to make sure your information is correct. <strong>What is
the name of the bottom program?</strong></p>
<h2 id="part-two" class="section-header"><a href="#part-two">Part Two</a></h2>
<p>The programs explain the situation: they can't get down. Rather, they <strong>could</strong> get down, if
they weren't expending all of their energy trying to keep the tower balanced. Apparently, one
program has the <strong>wrong weight</strong>, and until it's fixed, they're stuck here.</p>
<p>For any program holding a disc, each program standing on that disc forms a sub-tower. Each of
those sub-towers are supposed to be the same weight, or the disc itself isn't balanced. The
weight of a tower is the sum of the weights of the programs in that tower.</p>
<p>In the example above, this means that for <code>ugml</code>'s disc to be balanced, <code>gyxo</code>, <code>ebii</code>, and
<code>jptl</code> must all have the same weight, and they do: <code>61</code>.</p>
<p>However, for <code>tknk</code> to be balanced, each of the programs standing on its disc <strong>and all programs
above it</strong> must each match. This means that the following sums must all be the same:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ugml</code> + (<code>gyxo</code> + <code>ebii</code> + <code>jptl</code>) = 68 + (61 + 61 + 61) = 251</li>
<li><code>padx</code> + (<code>pbga</code> + <code>havc</code> + <code>qoyq</code>) = 45 + (66 + 66 + 66) = 243</li>
<li><code>fwft</code> + (<code>ktlj</code> + <code>cntj</code> + <code>xhth</code>) = 72 + (57 + 57 + 57) = 243</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, <code>tknk</code>'s disc is unbalanced: <code>ugml</code>'s stack is heavier than the other two. Even
though the nodes above <code>ugml</code> are balanced, <code>ugml</code> itself is too heavy: it needs to be <code>8</code> units
lighter for its stack to weigh <code>243</code> and keep the towers balanced. If this change were made, its
weight would be <code>60</code>.</p>
<p>Given that exactly one program is the wrong weight, <strong>what would its weight need to be</strong> to
balance the entire tower?</p>
