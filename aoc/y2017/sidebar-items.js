We can't print the Naughty or Nice List!\" By the time you make it to sub-basement 17, there are only a few minutes until midnight. \"We have a big problem,\" she says; \"there must be almost fifty bugs in this system, but nothing else can print The List. Stand in this square, quick! There's no time to explain; if you can convince them to pay you in stars, you'll be able to--\" She pulls a lever and the world goes blurry."],["d02","Day 2: Corruption ChecksumAs you walk through the door, a glowing humanoid shape yells in your direction. \"You there! Your state appears to be idle. Come help us repair the corruption in this spreadsheet - if we take another millisecond, we'll have to display an hourglass cursor!\""],["d03","Day 3: Spiral MemoryYou come across an experimental new kind of memory stored on an infinite two-dimensional grid."],["d04","Day 4: High-Entropy PassphrasesA new system policy has been put in place that requires all accounts to use a passphrase instead of simply a password. A passphrase consists of a series of words (lowercase letters) separated by spaces."],["d05","Day 5: A Maze of Twisty Trampolines, All AlikeAn urgent interrupt arrives from the CPU: it's trapped in a maze of jump instructions, and it would like assistance from any programs with spare cycles to help find the exit."],["d06","Day 6: Memory ReallocationA debugger program here is having an issue: it is trying to repair a memory reallocation routine, but it keeps getting stuck in an infinite loop."],["d07","Day 7: Recursive CircusWandering further through the circuits of the computer, you come upon a tower of programs that have gotten themselves into a bit of trouble. A recursive algorithm has gotten out of hand, and now they're balanced precariously in a large tower."],["d08","Day 8: I Heard You Like RegistersYou receive a signal directly from the CPU. Because of your recent assistance with jump instructions, it would like you to compute the result of a series of unusual register instructions."],["d09","Day 9: Stream ProcessingA large stream blocks your path. According to the locals, it's not safe to cross the stream at the moment because it's full of garbage. You look down at the stream; rather than water, you discover that it's a stream of characters."],["d10","Day 10: Knot HashYou come across some programs that are trying to implement a software emulation of a hash based on knot-tying. The hash these programs are implementing isn't very strong, but you decide to help them anyway. You make a mental note to remind the Elves later not to invent their own cryptographic functions."],["d11","Day 11: Hex EdCrossing the bridge, you've barely reached the other side of the stream when a program comes up to you, clearly in distress. \"It's my child process,\" she says, \"he's gotten lost in an infinite grid!\""],["d12","Day 12: Digital PlumberWalking along the memory banks of the stream, you find a small village that is experiencing a little confusion: some programs can't communicate with each other."],["d13","Day 13: Packet ScannersYou need to cross a vast firewall. The firewall consists of several layers, each with a security scanner that moves back and forth across the layer. To succeed, you must not be detected by a scanner."],["d14","Day 14: Disk DefragmentationSuddenly, a scheduled job activates the system's disk defragmenter. Were the situation different, you might sit and watch it for a while, but today, you just don't have that kind of time. It's soaking up valuable system resources that are needed elsewhere, and so the only option is to help it finish its task as soon as possible."],["d15","Day 15: Dueling GeneratorsHere, you encounter a pair of dueling generators. The generators, called generator A and generator B, are trying to agree on a sequence of numbers. However, one of them is malfunctioning, and so the sequences don't always match."],["d16","Day 16: Permutation PromenadeYou come upon a very unusual sight; a group of programs here appear to be dancing."],["d17","Day 17: SpinlockSuddenly, whirling in the distance, you notice what looks like a massive, pixelated hurricane: a deadly spinlock. This spinlock isn't just consuming computing power, but memory, too; vast, digital mountains are being ripped from the ground and consumed by the vortex."],["d18","Day 18: DuetYou discover a tablet containing some strange assembly code labeled simply \"Duet\". Rather than bother the sound card with it, you decide to run the code yourself. Unfortunately, you don't see any documentation, so you're left to figure out what the instructions mean on your own."],["d19","Day 19: A Series of TubesSomehow, a network packet got lost and ended up here. It's trying to follow a routing diagram (your puzzle input), but it's confused about where to go."],["d20","Day 20: Particle SwarmSuddenly, the GPU contacts you, asking for help. Someone has asked it to simulate too many particles, and it won't be able to finish them all in time to render the next frame at this rate."],["d21","Day 21: Fractal ArtYou find a program trying to generate some art. It uses a strange process that involves repeatedly enhancing the detail of an image through a set of rules."],["d22","Day 22: Sporifica VirusDiagnostics indicate that the local grid computing cluster has been contaminated with the Sporifica Virus. The grid computing cluster is a seemingly-infinite two-dimensional grid of compute nodes. Each node is either clean or infected by the virus."],["d23","Day 23: Coprocessor ConflagrationYou decide to head directly to the CPU and fix the printer from there. As you get close, you find an experimental coprocessor doing so much work that the local programs are afraid it will halt and catch fire. This would cause serious issues for the rest of the computer, so you head in and see what you can do."],["d24","Day 24: Electromagnetic MoatThe CPU itself is a large, black building surrounded by a bottomless pit. Enormous metal tubes extend outward from the side of the building at regular intervals and descend down into the void. There's no way to cross, but you need to get inside."],["d25","Day 25: The Halting ProblemFollowing the twisty passageways deeper and deeper into the CPU, you finally reach the core of the computer. Here, in the expansive central chamber, you find a grand apparatus that fills the entire room, suspended nanometers above your head."]]});
