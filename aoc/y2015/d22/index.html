<p>Little Henry Case decides that defeating bosses with <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/21">swords and stuff</a> is boring. Now he's
playing the game with a wizard. Of course, he gets stuck on another boss and needs your help
again.</p>
<p>In this version, combat still proceeds with the player and the boss taking alternating turns.
The player still goes first. Now, however, you don't get any equipment; instead, you must choose
one of your spells to cast. The first character at or below <code>0</code> hit points loses.</p>
<p>Since you're a wizard, you don't get to wear armor, and you can't attack normally. However,
since you do <strong>magic damage</strong>, your opponent's armor is ignored, and so the boss effectively has
zero armor as well. As before, if armor (from a spell, in this case) would reduce damage below
<code>1</code>, it becomes <code>1</code> instead - that is, the boss' attacks always deal at least <code>1</code> damage.</p>
<p>On each of your turns, you must select one of your spells to cast. If you cannot afford to cast
any spell, you lose. Spells cost <strong>mana</strong>; you start with <strong>500</strong> mana, but have no maximum
limit. You must have enough mana to cast a spell, and its cost is immediately deducted when you
cast it. Your spells are Magic Missile, Drain, Shield, Poison, and Recharge.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Magic Missile</strong> costs <code>53</code> mana. It instantly does <code>4</code> damage.</li>
<li><strong>Drain</strong> costs <code>73</code> mana. It instantly does <code>2</code> damage and heals you for <code>2</code> hit points.</li>
<li><strong>Shield</strong> costs <code>113</code> mana. It starts an <strong>effect</strong> that lasts for <code>6</code> turns. While it is
active, your armor is increased by <code>7</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Poison</strong> costs <code>173</code> mana. It starts an <strong>effect</strong> that lasts for <code>6</code> turns. At the start of
each turn while it is active, it deals the boss <code>3</code> damage.</li>
<li><strong>Recharge</strong> costs <code>229</code> mana. It starts an <strong>effect</strong> that lasts for <code>5</code> turns. At the start
of each turn while it is active, it gives you <code>101</code> new mana.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Effects</strong> all work the same way. Effects apply at the start of both the player's turns and the
boss' turns. Effects are created with a timer (the number of turns they last); at the start of
each turn, after they apply any effect they have, their timer is decreased by one. If this
decreases the timer to zero, the effect ends. You cannot cast a spell that would start an effect
which is already active. However, effects can be started on the same turn they end.</p>
<p>For example, suppose the player has <code>10</code> hit points and <code>250</code> mana, and that the boss has <code>13</code>
hit points and <code>8</code> damage:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">-- Player turn --
- Player has 10 hit points, 0 armor, 250 mana
- Boss has 13 hit points
Player casts Poison.

-- Boss turn --
- Player has 10 hit points, 0 armor, 77 mana
- Boss has 13 hit points
Poison deals 3 damage; its timer is now 5.
Boss attacks for 8 damage.

-- Player turn --
- Player has 2 hit points, 0 armor, 77 mana

Poison deals 3 damage; its timer is now 4.
Player casts Magic Missile, dealing 4 damage.

-- Boss turn --
- Player has 2 hit points, 0 armor, 24 mana
- Boss has 3 hit points
Poison deals 3 damage. This kills the boss, and the player wins.
</code></pre>
<p>Now, suppose the same initial conditions, except that the boss has <code>14</code> hit points instead:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">-- Player turn --
- Player has 10 hit points, 0 armor, 250 mana
- Boss has 14 hit points

<p>You start with <strong>50 hit points</strong> and <strong>500 mana points</strong>. The boss's actual stats are in your
puzzle input. What is the <strong>least amount of mana</strong> you can spend and still win the fight? (Do
not include mana recharge effects as &quot;spending&quot; negative mana.)</p>
