She sounded pretty worried when she called you down here. \"At 500-year intervals into the past, someone has been changing Santa's history!\""],["d02","Day 2: Inventory Management SystemYou stop falling through time, catch your breath, and check the screen on the device. \"Destination reached. Current Year: 1518. Current Location: North Pole Utility Closet 83N10.\" You made it! Now, to find those anomalies."],["d03","Day 3: No Matter How You Slice ItThe Elves managed to locate the chimney-squeeze prototype fabric for Santa's suit (thanks to someone who helpfully wrote its box IDs on the wall of the warehouse in the middle of the night). Unfortunately, anomalies are still affecting them - nobody can even agree on how to cut the fabric."],["d04","Day 4: Repose RecordYou've sneaked into another supply closet - this time, it's across from the prototype suit manufacturing lab. You need to sneak inside and fix the issues with the suit, but there's a guard stationed outside the lab, so this is as close as you can safely get."],["d05","Day 5: Alchemical ReductionYou've managed to sneak in to the prototype suit manufacturing lab. The Elves are making decent progress, but are still struggling with the suit's size reduction capabilities."],["d06","Day 6: Chronal CoordinatesThe device on your wrist beeps several times, and once again you feel like you're falling."],["d07","Day 7: The Sum of Its PartsYou find yourself standing on a snow-covered coastline; apparently, you landed a little off course. The region is too hilly to see the North Pole from here, but you do spot some Elves that seem to be trying to unpack something that washed ashore. It's quite cold out, so you decide to risk creating a paradox by asking them for directions."],["d08","Day 8: Memory ManeuverThe sleigh is much easier to pull than you'd expect for something its weight. Unfortunately, neither you nor the Elves know which way the North Pole is from here."],["d09","Day 9: Marble ManiaYou talk to the Elves while you wait for your navigation system to initialize. To pass the time, they introduce you to their favorite marble game."],["d10","Day 10: The Stars AlignIt's no use; your navigation system simply isn't capable of providing walking directions in the arctic circle, and certainly not in 1018."],["d11","Day 11: Chronal ChargeYou watch the Elves and their sleigh fade into the distance as they head toward the North Pole."],["d12","Day 12: Subterranean SustainabilityThe year 518 is significantly more underground than your history books implied. Either that, or you've arrived in a vast cavern network under the North Pole."],["d13","Day 13: Mine Cart MadnessA crop of this size requires significant logistics to transport produce, soil, fertilizer, and so on. The Elves are very busy pushing things around in carts on some kind of rudimentary system of tracks they've come up with."],["d14","Day 14: Chocolate ChartsYou finally have a chance to look at all of the produce moving around. Chocolate, cinnamon, mint, chili peppers, nutmeg, vanilla... the Elves must be growing these plants to make hot chocolate! As you realize this, you hear a conversation in the distance. When you go to investigate, you discover two Elves in what appears to be a makeshift underground kitchen/laboratory."],["d15","Day 15: Beverage BanditsHaving perfected their hot chocolate, the Elves have a new problem: the Goblins that live in these caves will do anything to steal it. Looks like they're here for a fight."],["d16","Day 16: Chronal ClassificationAs you see the Elves defend their hot chocolate successfully, you go back to falling through time. This is going to become a problem."],["d17","Day 17: Reservoir ResearchYou arrive in the year 18. If it weren't for the coat you got in 1018, you would be very cold: the North Pole base hasn't even been constructed."],["d18","Day 18: Settlers of The North PoleOn the outskirts of the North Pole base construction project, many Elves are collecting lumber."],["d19","Day 19: Go With The FlowWith the Elves well on their way constructing the North Pole base, you turn your attention back to understanding the inner workings of programming the device."],["d20","Day 20: A Regular MapWhile you were learning about instruction pointers, the Elves made considerable progress. When you look up, you discover that the North Pole base construction project has completely surrounded you."],["d21","Day 21: Chronal ConversionYou should have been watching where you were going, because as you wander the new North Pole base, you trip and fall into a very deep hole!"],["d22","Day 22: Mode MazeThis is it, your final stop: the year -483. It's snowing and dark outside; the only light you can see is coming from a small cottage in the distance. You make your way there and knock on the door."],["d23","Day 23: Experimental Emergency TeleportationUsing your torch to search the darkness of the rocky cavern, you finally locate the man's friend: a small reindeer."],["d24","Day 24: Immune System Simulator 20XXAfter a weird buzzing noise, you appear back at the man's cottage. He seems relieved to see his friend, but quickly notices that the little reindeer caught some kind of cold while out exploring."],["d25","Day 25: Four-Dimensional AdventureThe reindeer's symptoms are getting worse, and neither you nor the white-bearded man have a solution. At least the reindeer has a warm place to rest: a small bed near where you're sitting."]]});
