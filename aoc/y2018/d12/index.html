<p>The year 518 is significantly more underground than your history books implied. Either that, or
you've arrived in a vast cavern network under the North Pole.</p>
<p>After exploring a little, you discover a long tunnel that contains a row of small pots as far as
you can see to your left and right. A few of them contain plants - someone is trying to grow
things in these geothermally-heated caves.</p>
<p>The pots are numbered, with <code>0</code> in front of you. To the left, the pots are numbered <code>-1</code>, <code>-2</code>,
<code>-3</code>, and so on; to the right, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>.... Your puzzle input contains a list of pots from
<code>0</code> to the right and whether they do (<code>#</code>) or do not (<code>.</code>) currently contain a plant, the
<strong>initial state</strong>. (No other pots currently contain plants.) For example, an initial state of
<code>#..##....</code> indicates that pots <code>0</code>, <code>3</code>, and <code>4</code> currently contain plants.</p>
<p>Your puzzle input also contains some notes you find on a nearby table: someone has been trying
to figure out how these plants <strong>spread</strong> to nearby pots. Based on the notes, for each
generation of plants, a given pot has or does not have a plant based on whether that pot (and
the two pots on either side of it) had a plant in the last generation. These are written as
<code>LLCRR =&gt; N</code>, where <code>L</code> are pots to the left, <code>C</code> is the current pot being considered, <code>R</code> are
the pots to the right, and <code>N</code> is whether the current pot will have a plant in the next
generation. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A note like <code>..#.. =&gt; .</code> means that a pot that contains a plant but with no plants within two
pots of it will not have a plant in it during the next generation.</li>
<li>A note like <code>##.## =&gt; .</code> means that an empty pot with two plants on each side of it will
remain empty in the next generation.</li>
<li>A note like <code>.##.# =&gt; #</code> means that a pot has a plant in a given generation if, in the
previous generation, there were plants in that pot, the one immediately to the left, and the
one two pots to the right, but not in the ones immediately to the right and two to the left.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not clear what these plants are for, but you're sure it's important, so you'd like to make
sure the current configuration of plants is sustainable by determining what will happen after
<strong><code>20</code> generations</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, given the following input:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">initial state: #..#.#..##......###...###

...## =&gt; #
..#.. =&gt; #
.#... =&gt; #
.#.#. =&gt; #
.#.## =&gt; #
.##.. =&gt; #
.#### =&gt; #
#.#.# =&gt; #
#.### =&gt; #
##.#. =&gt; #
##.## =&gt; #
###.. =&gt; #
###.# =&gt; #
####. =&gt; #
</code></pre>
<p>For brevity, in this example, only the combinations which do produce a plant are listed. (Your
input includes all possible combinations.) Then, the next 20 generations will look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">                 1         2         3
       0         0         0         0
 0: ...#..#.#..##......###...###...........
 1: ...#...#....#.....#..#..#..#...........
 2: ...##..##...##....#..#..#..##..........
 3: ..#.#...#..#.#....#..#..#...#..........
 4: ...#.#..#...#.#...#..#..##..##.........
 5: ....#...##...#.#..#..#...#...#.........
 6: ....##.#.#....#...#..##..##..##........
 7: ...#..###.#...##..#...#...#...#........
 8: ...#....##.#.#.#..##..##..##..##.......
 9: ...##..#..#####....#...#...#...#.......
10: ..#.#..#...#.##....##..##..##..##......
11: ...#...##...#.#...#.#...#...#...#......
12: ...##.#.#....#.#...#.#..##..##..##.....
13: ..#..###.#....#.#...#....#...#...#.....
14: ..#....##.#....#.#..##...##..##..##....
15: ..##..#..#.#....#....#..#.#...#...#....
16: .#.#..#...#.#...##...#...#.#..##..##...
17: ..#...##...#.#.#.#...##...#....#...#...
18: ..##.#.#....#####.#.#.#...##...##..##..
19: .#..###.#..#.#.#######.#.#.#..#.#...#..
20: .#....##....#####...#######....#.#..##.
</code></pre>
<p>The generation is shown along the left, where <code>0</code> is the initial state. The pot numbers are
shown along the top, where <code>0</code> labels the center pot, negative-numbered pots extend to the left,
and positive pots extend toward the right. Remember, the initial state begins at pot <code>0</code>, which
is not the leftmost pot used in this example.</p>
<p>After one generation, only seven plants remain. The one in pot <code>0</code> matched the rule looking for
<code>..#..</code>, the one in pot <code>4</code> matched the rule looking for <code>.#.#.</code>, pot <code>9</code> matched <code>.##..</code>, and
so on.</p>
<p>In this example, after 20 generations, the pots shown as <code>#</code> contain plants, the furthest left
of which is pot <code>-2</code>, and the furthest right of which is pot <code>34</code>. Adding up all the numbers of
plant-containing pots after the 20th generation produces <strong><code>325</code></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>After <code>20</code> generations, what is the sum of the numbers of all pots which contain a plant?</strong></p>
