Unfortunately, the stars have been stolen... by the Easter Bunny. To save Christmas, Santa needs you to retrieve all fifty stars by December 25th."],["d02","Day 2: Bathroom SecurityYou arrive at Easter Bunny Headquarters under cover of darkness. However, you left in such a rush that you forgot to use the bathroom! Fancy office buildings like this one usually have keypad locks on their bathrooms, so you search the front desk for the code."],["d03","Day 3: Squares With Three SidesNow that you can think clearly, you move deeper into the labyrinth of hallways and office furniture that makes up this part of Easter Bunny HQ. This must be a graphic design department; the walls are covered in specifications for triangles."],["d04","Day 4: Security Through ObscurityFinally, you come across an information kiosk with a list of rooms. Of course, the list is encrypted and full of decoy data, but the instructions to decode the list are barely hidden nearby. Better remove the decoy data first."],["d05","Day 5: How About a Nice Game of Chess?You are faced with a security door designed by Easter Bunny engineers that seem to have acquired most of their security knowledge by watching hacking movies."],["d06","Day 6: Signals and NoiseSomething is jamming your communications with Santa. Fortunately, your signal is only partially jammed, and protocol in situations like this is to switch to a simple repetition code to get the message through."],["d07","Day 7: Internet Protocol Version 7While snooping around the local network of EBHQ, you compile a list of IP addresses (they're IPv7, of course; IPv6 is much too limited). You'd like to figure out which IPs support TLS (transport-layer snooping)."],["d08","Day 8: Two-Factor AuthenticationYou come across a door implementing what you can only assume is an implementation of two-factor authentication after a long game of requirements telephone."],["d09","Day 9: Explosives in CyberspaceWandering around a secure area, you come across a datalink port to a new part of the network. After briefly scanning it for interesting files, you find one file in particular that catches your attention. It's compressed with an experimental format, but fortunately, the documentation for the format is nearby."],["d10","Day 10: Balance BotsYou come upon a factory in which many robots are zooming around handing small microchips to each other."],["d11","Day 11: Radioisotope Thermoelectric GeneratorsYou come upon a column of four floors that have been entirely sealed off from the rest of the building except for a small dedicated lobby. There are some radiation warnings and a big sign which reads \"Radioisotope Testing Facility\"."],["d12","Day 12: Leonardo's MonorailYou finally reach the top floor of this building: a garden with a slanted glass ceiling. Looks like there are no more stars to be had."],["d13","Day 13: A Maze of Twisty Little CubiclesYou arrive at the first floor of this new building to discover a much less welcoming environment than the shiny atrium of the last one. Instead, you are in a maze of twisty little cubicles, all alike."],["d14","Day 14: One-Time PadIn order to communicate securely with Santa while you're on this mission, you've been using a one-time pad that you generate using a pre-agreed algorithm. Unfortunately, you've run out of keys in your one-time pad, and so you need to generate some more."],["d15","Day 15: Timing is EverythingThe halls open into an interior plaza containing a large kinetic sculpture. The sculpture is in a sealed enclosure and seems to involve a set of identical spherical capsules that are carried to the top and allowed to bounce through the maze of spinning pieces."],["d16","Day 16: Dragon ChecksumYou're done scanning this part of the network, but you've left traces of your presence. You need to overwrite some disks with random-looking data to cover your tracks and update the local security system with a new checksum for those disks."],["d17","Day 17: Two Steps ForwardYou're trying to access a secure vault protected by a `4x4` grid of small rooms connected by doors. You start in the top-left room (marked `S`), and you can access the vault (marked `V`) once you reach the bottom-right room:"],["d18","Day 18: Like a RogueAs you enter this room, you hear a loud click! Some of the tiles in the floor here seem to be pressure plates for traps, and the trap you just triggered has run out of... whatever it tried to do to you. You doubt you'll be so lucky next time."],["d19","Day 19: An Elephant Named JosephThe Elves contact you over a highly secure emergency channel. Back at the North Pole, the Elves are busy misunderstanding White Elephant parties."],["d20","Day 20: Firewall RulesYou'd like to set up a small hidden computer here so you can use it to get back into the network later. However, the corporate firewall only allows communication with certain external IP addresses."],["d21","Day 21: Scrambled Letters and HashThe computer system you're breaking into uses a weird scrambling function to store its passwords. It shouldn't be much trouble to create your own scrambled password so you can add it to the system; you just have to implement the scrambler."],["d22","Day 22: Grid ComputingYou gain access to a massive storage cluster arranged in a grid; each storage node is only connected to the four nodes directly adjacent to it (three if the node is on an edge, two if it's in a corner)."],["d23","Day 23: Safe CrackingThis is one of the top floors of the nicest tower in EBHQ. The Easter Bunny's private office is here, complete with a safe hidden behind a painting, and who wouldn't hide a star in a safe behind a painting?"],["d24","Day 24: Air Duct SpelunkingYou've finally met your match; the doors that provide access to the roof are locked tight, and all of the controls and related electronics are inaccessible. You simply can't reach them."],["d25","Day 25: Clock SignalYou open the door and find yourself on the roof. The city sprawls away from you for miles and miles."]]});
