To accurately calculate his position in space, safely align his warp drive, and return to Earth in time to save Christmas, he needs you to bring him measurements from fifty stars."],["d02","Day 2: 1202 Program AlarmOn the way to your gravity assist around the Moon, your ship computer beeps angrily about a \"1202 program alarm\". On the radio, an Elf is already explaining how to handle the situation: \"Don't worry, that's perfectly norma--\" The ship computer bursts into flames."],["d03","Day 3: Crossed WiresThe gravity assist was successful, and you're well on your way to the Venus refuelling station. During the rush back on Earth, the fuel management system wasn't completely installed, so that's next on the priority list."],["d04","Day 4: Secure ContainerYou arrive at the Venus fuel depot only to discover it's protected by a password. The Elves had written the password on a sticky note, but someone threw it out."],["d05","Day 5: Sunny with a Chance of AsteroidsYou're starting to sweat as the ship makes its way toward Mercury. The Elves suggest that you get the air conditioner working by upgrading your ship computer to support the Thermal Environment Supervision Terminal."],["d06","Day 6: Universal Orbit MapYou've landed at the Universal Orbit Map facility on Mercury. Because navigation in space often involves transferring between orbits, the orbit maps here are useful for finding efficient routes between, for example, you and Santa. You download a map of the local orbits (your puzzle input)."],["d07","Day 7: Amplification CircuitBased on the navigational maps, you're going to need to send more power to your ship's thrusters to reach Santa in time. To do this, you'll need to configure a series of amplifiers already installed on the ship."],["d08","Day 8: Space Image FormatThe Elves' spirits are lifted when they realize you have an opportunity to reboot one of their Mars rovers, and so they are curious if you would spend a brief sojourn on Mars. You land your ship near the rover."],["d09","Day 9: Sensor BoostYou've just said goodbye to the rebooted rover and left Mars when you receive a faint distress signal coming from the asteroid belt. It must be the Ceres monitoring station!"],["d10","Day 10: Monitoring StationYou fly into the asteroid belt and reach the Ceres monitoring station. The Elves here have an emergency: they're having trouble tracking all of the asteroids and can't be sure they're safe."],["d11","Day 11: Space PoliceOn the way to Jupiter, you're pulled over by the Space Police."],["d12","Day 12: The N-Body ProblemThe space near Jupiter is not a very safe place; you need to be careful of a big distracting red spot, extreme radiation, and a whole lot of moons swirling around. You decide to start by tracking the four largest moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto."],["d13","Day 13: Care PackageAs you ponder the solitude of space and the ever-increasing three-hour roundtrip for messages between you and Earth, you notice that the Space Mail Indicator Light is blinking. To help keep you sane, the Elves have sent you a care package."],["d14","Day 14: Space StoichiometryAs you approach the rings of Saturn, your ship's low fuel indicator turns on. There isn't any fuel here, but the rings have plenty of raw material. Perhaps your ship's Inter-Stellar Refinery Union brand nanofactory can turn these raw materials into fuel."],["d15","Day 15: Oxygen SystemOut here in deep space, many things can go wrong. Fortunately, many of those things have indicator lights. Unfortunately, one of those lights is lit: the oxygen system for part of the ship has failed!"],["d16","Day 16: Flawed Frequency TransmissionYou're 3/4ths of the way through the gas giants. Not only do roundtrip signals to Earth take five hours, but the signal quality is quite bad as well. You can clean up the signal with the Flawed Frequency Transmission algorithm, or FFT."],["d17","Day 17: Set and ForgetAn early warning system detects an incoming solar flare and automatically activates the ship's electromagnetic shield. Unfortunately, this has cut off the Wi-Fi for many small robots that, unaware of the impending danger, are now trapped on exterior scaffolding on the unsafe side of the shield. To rescue them, you'll have to act quickly!"],["d18","Day 18: Many-Worlds InterpretationAs you approach Neptune, a planetary security system detects you and activates a giant tractor beam on Triton! You have no choice but to land."],["d19","Day 19: Tractor BeamUnsure of the state of Santa's ship, you borrowed the tractor beam technology from Triton. Time to test it out."],["d20","Day 20: Donut MazeYou notice a strange pattern on the surface of Pluto and land nearby to get a closer look. Upon closer inspection, you realize you've come across one of the famous space-warping mazes of the long-lost Pluto civilization!"],["d21","Day 21: Springdroid AdventureYou lift off from Pluto and start flying in the direction of Santa."],["d22","Day 22: Slam ShuffleThere isn't much to do while you wait for the droids to repair your ship. At least you're drifting in the right direction. You decide to practice a new card shuffle you've been working on."],["d23","Day 23: Category SixThe droids have finished repairing as much of the ship as they can. Their report indicates that this was a Category 6 disaster - not because it was that bad, but because it destroyed the stockpile of Category 6 network cables as well as most of the ship's network infrastructure."],["d24","Day 24: Planet of DiscordYou land on Eris, your last stop before reaching Santa. As soon as you do, your sensors start picking up strange life forms moving around: Eris is infested with bugs!
